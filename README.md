# PRODIGY_DS_02

This repository contains the code and analysis for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Infotech. I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

#Task Description
The goal was to clean the data and perform EDA to uncover patterns and trends, focusing on variables like gender, passenger class, age, fare, and survival rate.

#Analysis Highlights
Handled missing values and duplicates.
Explored key relationships such as the higher survival rate among females and the impact of passenger class on survival.
#Conclusion
This analysis revealed valuable insights into the factors affecting survival during the Titanic disaster and demonstrated the use of data science techniques for understanding real-world data.
